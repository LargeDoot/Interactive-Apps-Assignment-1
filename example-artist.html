            <p id="justify">
                Monarchy are a British rock band made up of Fred Venus, Bryan June, Roger Cobbler and Jon Vicars. They
                formed in Preston in 1970 after Bryan and Roger left their previous band 'Cheesy Grin'. They achieved
                moderate chart success and have played to large stadiums such as the Globe Arena, Deepdale Stadium and
                Gigg Lane. Their first album 'Monarchy' reached a high point of 164 in the album charts in 1974, while
                their 1975 album 'Night at the Guildhall' brought them international success and was the top selling
                album that year in Liechtenstein. That album featured the single 'Slavic Symphony', which stayed at
                number one in the UK for nine seconds.
