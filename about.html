            <ul>
                <li>Used tutorial at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_make_a_website.asp">w3schools</a> to create a basic
                    layout
                    for the site, including:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>a header</li>
                    <li>a navigation bar</li>
                    <li>a side contect area</li>
                    <li>a main content area</li>
                    <li>and a footer</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Added CSS classes for use on this 'About' page.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Class for images on the page to give them a thick border and the correct sizing</li>
                    <li>Class for the captions below the images.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Added first contect to this 'About' page!</li>

            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="row">

        <div class="side-content">

            <img src="images/version-screenshots/v2.png" alt="Version two of this site's home page, that shows the table that was added to the home page.">
            <p class="caption">The table added to the homepage.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="main-content">


            <p>Next, I created a price and package comparison table on the main page that scales with smaller
                devices well. I had a couple problems with the creation of this table, such as: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>getting horizontal borders to render properly</li>
                <li>stopping the table from collapsing on itself when on a narrow display</li>
                <li>getting the first column to be wider than the rest</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To get around these problems I:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>set "border-collapse" to "collapse"</li>
                <li>set "min-width" valuses for the table elements (in vw units)</li>
                <li>set "width" in vw units for the first column</li>
            </ul>

        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="row">

        <div class="side-content">

            <img src="images/version-screenshots/v3.png" alt="Version three of this site's home page, that shows the newly implemented music selection page.">
            <p class="caption">The newly implemented music selection page.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="main-content">

            <br><br>
            <p>For the next stage, I implemented the music selection page which contains a table with a set of example
                songs/albums that will eventually be available to the clients users. The table can be filtered by genre
                using a search box located beside the table. A few things I used for this page were:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>setting background images for elements (i.e. the search icon in the search bar)</li>
                <li>adding javascript to the page to allow the bar to work</li>
                <li>exploring with flexboxes to reach the desired design</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For help with the search bar, I used a very useful resource from
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_filter_table.asp" target="_blank">w3schools</a>.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>For the next stage, I implemented the featured artist page that shows off an artist and their work. The
                page has a small biography on the left, and a selection of album artwork on the right. I used flexboxes
                for the images and have created two media queries to arrange the images differently with different
                screen sizes. When the screen gets smallerThis is what I found most difficult when creating this page.</p>

            <p>I was able to re-use a lot of classes to do with images in this page, so not much to say.</p>
